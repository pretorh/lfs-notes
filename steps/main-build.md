# Building the LFS system

These notes are from Chapter 8 of the 10.0 version

## setup

These steps need to be done in chroot - reenter after cleanup/backup or a restore from a backup. See notes in chroot setup (`steps/6-install.md`)

Todo: recheck enter scripts, since `mknod` commands fail (already exists)

See notes about package management
